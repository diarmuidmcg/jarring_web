      JarRing was developed by Diarmuid McGonagle, a student at Trinity College
      Dublin. It is created with Kotlin Multiplatform &amp; MongoDB's Realm
      Sync. The initial intention of the project was to solve a simple problem
      that Diarmuid was facing with his flatmates.
      <br />
      Diarmuid, an American who adores peanut butter, began consolidating a
      large amount of empty jars. Being resourseful, he began cleaning them out
      &amp; reusing them, putting various products in them: teas, coffee beans,
      couscous, &amp; more.
      <br />
      Before long, his pantry was unmanagable with dozens of label-less jars
      containing various teas &amp; lookalikable products (how do you
      differentiate caffeinated beans from decaf?). To solve this simple issue,
      he created JarRing.
